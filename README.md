# [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)

### This is my solution to the FCC Exercise Tracker Certification Project

#### Verified solve for

- mongo connection
- user schema
- exercise schema
- exercise post routes
- user post routes
- exercise count
- user log creation
- user log get routes
- exercise date defaults

#### Hot tip - if your exercises post route is failing - make sure that your response is sending duration as number and not a string! I spent a good hour of frustration thinking my route was returning exactly what it needed to, only to notice after reading several threads that this was a common mixup by other students.
